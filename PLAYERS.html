            <p>As you might know by now, there are 30 players in a rugbyfield. Both teams have 15 players ready to play but also have some players on the bench, depending how many numbers a team has. Each of those 15 players have a different name and function during the game. A great explanation to what all of the different functions for each 
            player are on a field you can watch
